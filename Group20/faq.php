            <p>Because our website’s purpose is to provide information for a business, we decided to use a simple and minimalistic design. Our primary demographic of users are condo and townhouse owners of all age and gender, so we focussed on a design that was streamlined and accessible. We researched several different websites that contained similar content to ours and found that they focused on functionality and simplicity rather than being<br><br> aesthetically pleasing. We kept a uniform design for all our pages -- keeping the same layout for the navigation and banner, changing only the content to keep our website consistent.  The content will either be using a one column layout or a two column layout depending on how much </p>
